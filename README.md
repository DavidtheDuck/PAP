# Unity Robotics Hub

This is a central repository for tools, tutorials, resources, and documentation for robotic simulation in Unity.

For any questions or feedback, connect directly with the Robotics team at [unity-robotics@unity3d.com](mailto:unity-robotics@unity3d.com).

> The contents of this repository are in active development. Its features and API are subject to significant change as development progresses.

## Prerequisites
- A working [ROS environment](https://www.ros.org/install/)
	- These tutorials were created using ROS Melodic and Python 2.
- Unity version >= 2020.2

## Getting Started with Unity Robotics

| Section | Description |
|---|---|
| [Pick-and-Place End-to-End](tutorials/pick_and_place/README.md) | A complete end-to-end robotics environment - a simulated robot defined in URDF, controlled via two-way communication with ROS |
| [ROSâ€“Unity Integration](tutorials/ros_unity_integration/README.md) | Set up simple communication between ROS and Unity |
| [URDF Importer](tutorials/urdf_importer/urdf_tutorial.md) | Steps on using the Unity plugin for loading [URDF](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf) files (Unified Robot Description Format) | 
| [Articulations Robot Demo](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/articulations-robot-demo) | A robot simulation demonstrating Unity's new physics solver


## Component Repos
