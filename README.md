# Unity Robotics Hub

This is a central repository for tools, tutorials, resources, and documentation for robotic simulation in Unity.

If you have questions please feel free to contact us [here](mailto:unity-robotics@unity3d.com).

## Unity Robotics Tutorials

### Repos
- [TCP Endpoint ROS Package](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ROS-TCP-Endpoint)
	- A ROS node for sending/receiving messages from Unity.
- [TCP Connection Unity Scripts](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ROS-TCP-Connector)
	- A set of Unity components for sending/receiving messages from ROS. 
- [URDF Importer](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/URDF-Importer)
	- A Unity plugin for loading [URDF](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf) files (Unified Robot Description Format)
- [Articulations Robot Demo](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/articulations-robot-demo)
	- A robot simulation, demonstrating Unity's new physics solver.

### Prerequisites
- Knowledge of [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) and a working [ROS environment](https://www.ros.org/install/)
	- This tutorial was made using ROS Melodic and Python 2.
- Unity 2020.2 or newer

### Tutorials
- [ROSâ€“Unity Integration](tutorials/ros_unity_integration/README.md)
	- How to set up simple communication between ROS and Unity.
- [URDF Importer](tutorials/urdf_importer/urdf_tutorial.md)
- [Pick-and-Place End-to-End](tutorials/pick_and_place/README.md)
	- A complete end-to-end robotics environment - a simulated robot defined in URDF, controlled via two-way communication with ROS.
