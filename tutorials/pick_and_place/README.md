This part includes the preparation and setup necessary to run a naive pick and place task using MoveIt. Steps covered include creating and invoking a motion planning service in ROS, moving a Unity Articulation Body based on a calculated trajectory, and controlling a gripping tool to successfully grasp and drop an object.
