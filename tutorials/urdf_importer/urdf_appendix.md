# URDF Tutorials Appendix

## File Hierarchy
URDF files and associated meshes should be placed in a single folder within the Assets directory of Unity. We suggest creating a new folder with the robot's name and place the URDF file in its root with all associated mesh files in sub folders. Be sure to update the file locations as described by the URDF file.

## GameObject Hierarchy 

The robot imported in Unity follows a Parent -  Child hierarchy. 
- Robot GameObject
  - UrdfRobot Script: UrdfRobot.cs script contains functions to change the behaviors of the imported robot. The script is used to control a robot's behavior, compare against a URDF file, and export the robot as a URDF file.
  - Controller Script: Enables keyboard control of the robot. It can be modified to create custom controllers as described [here](##Guide-to-write-your-own-controller).
    - Link GameObject
        - Articulation Body: This component exposes the Physx 4.0 functionality in UnityEditor which enables robotic simulation. The API details can be found [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/2020.1/Documentation/ScriptReference/ArticulationBody.html).
        - UrdfJoint Script -  This script encapsulates details of the jointType and contains APIs to get information about the joints. It also contains helper functions for export of URDF file.
        - UrdfInertial Script: This script contains inertial data for the original configuration of joints and links. It also has helper function to export robot to a URDF file.
        - JointControl: This script is an auxiliary script to the Controller script and helps pass control information to the Articulation Body.
            - Visuals GameObject: This gameObject and its children store visual information for the robot. Like its position, orientation, visual primitives, meshes, materials etc.
            - Collisions GameObject: This gameObject and its children store collision information for the robot. Like its position, orientation, visual primitives, meshes, materials etc.

## URDF Comparator
![](images/urdf_comparator.png)

URDF comparator is a testing tool to compare two URDF files. This tool can be used to check wether the URDF file has been exported correctly. To use the URDF comparator:
- Click `Compare URDF Files` on the UrdfRobot script in the Inspector Window.
- A menu will open containing three text fields.
    - `Source URDF file`: Contains the path of the first URDF file to be compared
    - `Exported URDF file`: Contains the path of the second URDF file to be compared
    - `Log File Save Location`: Contains the save location of the lof file
- Click on button `Select` to open the File Explorer menu and select the location of the two URDF files.
- After the exported file location is selected, its location is automatically selected as location of `Log File Save Location`. You can choose your own save location by pressing the `Select` next to the text field.
- To compare the two URDF files press `Compare URDF Files` to generate the [log file](#URDF_Comparator).

## URDF_Comparator 
The URDF comparator generates a log file which details the results of the comparison. Log file contains two types of log blocks. One type of block details joint:

```
Log file contains comparison for every attribute contained in the source URDF file to the corresponding attribute in exported URDF file. Each attribute follows the format : 
```
<Attribute_Name>
Equal : <True/False>
<Attribute_Name>: Source: <Attribute_Value>
<Attribute_Name>: Exported: <Attribute_Value>
```
Some attributes generates a nullity check which checks for presence of attributes in both URDF files.

## Articulation Body axis definition 
![](images/Unity_coordinate.png)

The most commonly used Coordinate system is the right hand coordinate system which is shown in the figure above. It follows the convention that if your right-hand thumb represents the X direction, then the index finger and the middle finger stretched out uncrossed at right angles would represent the Y and Z direction respectively. Positive direction of rotation is represented by the curl of the fingers with the thumb stretched out.

Unity uses a left- hand coordinate system which defines the direction of the axis and positive direction of rotation in the same way as above but using the left hand. URDF Importer converts the position and orientation of the links and joints from LHS to RHS using the functions present in  Unity3D/Assets/RosSharp/Scripts/Extensions/TransformExtensinons.cs.

![](images/articulation_axis.png)
![](images/prismatic_articulation.png)

The exception to this is the axis of movement for Articulation Bodies. In local co-ordinates, x-axis is the chosen as default axis in which a joint will move. Articulation Bodies' anchor can be transformed which allows it to be rotated and transformed with respect to the world co-ordinate system. This enables the joint to be moved around different orientations. The importer changes the orientation of the [anchor](https://docs.unity3d.com/2020.1/Documentation/ScriptReference/ArticulationBody-anchorRotation.html) to allow the [joint position](https://docs.unity3d.com/2020.1/Documentation/ScriptReference/ArticulationBody-jointPosition.html) in reduced co-ordinates to be represent the value in right hand co-ordinate system.

Note: When the mesh is imported in Unity, the x axis is negated to convert the mesh from LHS co-ordinate system to RHS co-ordinate system. One can correct this by applying a rotation of 180Â° on y axis or pressing the button `Default Space` on the urdfRobot interface.

## Guide to write your own controller

Articulation Body allows the joints to be controlled by three methods:

1. Position Control
2. Torque Control 
3. Velocity Control

All types of control are governed by the Spring-Damper equation :

```
F = stiffness * (currentPosition - target) - damping * (currentVelocity - targetVelocity)
```

#### Example Code

Code for positional control can be divided into two scripts. One script would be attached to the root GameObject which represents the robot. This script would determine the correct position of the joint, directed by a control policy implemented by the user. The other end of the script is attached to the GameObject with ArticulationBody component which receives the target position and assigns that 
value to the articulation body.

**Note: This architecture can be changed according to the user's design.**

##### Controller Script

In this example the control policy is to reach the target position as determined by arrow keys. This is implemented in the Controller script. It registers the keystrokes to first select the articulation body to be moved and than according to arrow keys determines the direction of the movement and sets it in the JointControl script.

```C#
public class Controller : MonoBehaviour
    {

        public enum RotationDirection { None = 0, Positive = 1, Negative = -1 };
        public enum ControlType { PositionControl, TorqueControl}

        private ArticulationBody[] articulationChain;

        public ControlType control = ControlType.PositionControl;
        public int selectedIndex;
        public float speed = 5f; // Units: degree/s or m/s
        public float torque = 100f; // Units: Nm or N
        public float power; 
        public float acceleration = 5f;// Units: m/s^2 or degree/s^2

        
        void Start()
        {
            previousIndex = selectedIndex = 1;
            articulationChain = this.GetComponentsInChildren<ArticulationBody>();
            foreach (ArticulationBody joint in articulationChain)
            {
                joint.gameObject.AddComponent<JointControl>();
            }
        }

        void Update()
        {
            bool SelectionInput1 = Input.GetKeyDown("right");
            bool SelectionInput2 = Input.GetKeyDown("left");
            
            if (SelectionInput2)
            {
                if (selectedIndex == 1)
                {
                    selectedIndex = articulationChain.Length - 1;
                }
                else
                {
                    selectedIndex = selectedIndex - 1;
                }
            }
            else if (SelectionInput1)
            {
                if (selectedIndex == articulationChain.Length - 1)
                {
                    selectedIndex = 1;
                }
                else
                {
                    selectedIndex = selectedIndex + 1;
                }
            }
                
            
            UpdateDirection(selectedIndex);
        }

        /// <summary>
        /// Sets the direction of movement of the joint on every update
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="jointIndex">Index of the link selected in the Articulation Chain</param>
        private void UpdateDirection(int jointIndex)
        {
            float moveDirection = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");
            JointControl current = articulationChain[jointIndex].GetComponent<JointControl>();            //current.controltype = control;

            if(current.controltype != control)
                UpdateControlType(current);

            if (moveDirection > 0)
            {
                current.direction = RotationDirection.Positive;
            }
            else if (moveDirection < 0)
            {
                current.direction = RotationDirection.Negative;
            }
            else
            {
                current.direction = RotationDirection.None;
            }


        }


        public void UpdateControlType(JointControl joint)
        {
            joint.controltype = control;
            if(control == ControlType.PositionControl)
            {
                ArticulationDrive drive = joint.joint.xDrive;
                drive.stiffness = stiffness;
                drive.damping = 0;
                joint.joint.xDrive = drive;
            }

            else if (control == ControlType.TorqueControl)
            {
                ArticulationDrive drive = joint.joint.xDrive;
                drive.stiffness = stiffness;
                drive.damping = 0;
                joint.joint.xDrive = drive;
            }
        }
    }
```

##### Joint Control Script

The joint control script determines the direction in which the joint needs to moved and sends the command using Articulation Body API. In all three control systems, you can directly control the primary value of the control, i.e position, velocity and torque respectively in the aforementioned control system or you can set the control of these values depending upon a time derivative of these values, i.e, speed, acceleration and power. In the latter case we multiply the time derivate constants with the *delta* time between frames.

```C#
public class JointControl : MonoBehaviour
{
    RosSharp.Control.Controller controller;

    public RosSharp.Control.RotationDirection direction;
    public RosSharp.Control.ControlType controltype;
    public float speed ;
    public float torque ;
    public float acceleration;
    public ArticulationBody joint;

    void Start()
    {
        direction = 0;
        controller = (RosSharp.Control.Controller)this.GetComponentInParent(typeof(RosSharp.Control.Controller));
        joint = this.GetComponent<ArticulationBody>();
        controller.UpdateControlType(this);
        speed = controller.speed;
        torque = controller.torque;
        acceleration = controller.acceleration;
    }

    void FixedUpdate(){

        speed = controller.speed;
        torque = controller.torque;
        acceleration = controller.acceleration;

        if(joint.jointType != ArticulationJointType.FixedJoint)
        {
            if (controltype == RosSharp.Control.ControlType.PositionControl)
            {
                ArticulationDrive currentDrive = joint.xDrive;
                float newTargetDelta = (int)direction * Time.fixedDeltaTime * speed;
                currentDrive.target += newTargetDelta;
                joint.xDrive = currentDrive;
            }
            else if (controltype == RosSharp.Control.ControlType.TorqueControl)
            {
                ArticulationDrive currentDrive = joint.xDrive;

                if (joint.jointType == ArticulationJointType.PrismaticJoint)
                {
                    Vector3 force = new Vector3((int)direction * (torque + joint.jointForce[0]), 0, 0);
                    // Vector3 force = new Vector3((int)direction * (power * Time.fixedDeltaTime + joint.jointForce[0]), 0, 0);
                    joint.AddForce(force);
                }
                else
                {
                    Vector3 force = new Vector3((int)direction * (torque + joint.jointForce[0]), 0, 0);
                    // Vector3 force = new Vector3((int)direction * (power * Time.fixedDeltaTime + joint.jointForce[0]), 0, 0);
                    joint.AddTorque(force);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```

### Position Control 

Position Control can be imagined as adding a spring to a joint with linear spring in case of prismatic joint and a torsional spring in case of revolute joint. The joint follows Hooke's law:

![](images/hooke.png)

When we set the the [target](https://docs.unity3d.com/2020.1/Documentation/ScriptReference/ArticulationDrive-target.html) position of the Articulation Drive, we assign an equilibrium point for the spring. The difference between the current position and the target position generates a corrective force in the joint(spring) to move the joint to the target position.

Damping should be set to zero for pure positional control but can be set to a non-zero value to avoid rapid increase in joint speed. Make sure it is not set too high as it can counter the force generated by the spring.

Note: Best practices for velocity and torque control will be published in the future.

## Using FK Robot Script

FK Robot script calculates the position of the end effector based on the joint position of the Articulation Body and the DH parameters input by the user for the robot. It is automatically attached to the Robot GameObject when the controller is added to the Robot. It displays the transformation matrix for the end effector and the current joint position of the robot.

To insert DH parameters in the script :

- Click the `Add DH Parameters` button in the inspector window. Following window will appear.

![](images/DH_parameter.png)

- Fill the DH parameters for the robot starting from first joint and click `Add DH parameter`.
- The added DH parameter will appear on the text box below.
